# V(ariety) O(f) F(iber) O(rientation) TENSORS

This repository contains a Python package called `vofotensors`  
which contains most of the parameterizations of fiber orientation tensors
defined in the paper

## Installation

- [Clone][url_how_to_clone] this repository to your machine
- Open a terminal and navigate to your local clone
- Install the package from the local clone into the current [env][url_env_python]i[ronment][url_env_conda] in develop mode:
	```shell
	python setup.py develop
	```
